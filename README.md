# My Vim/NeoVim Config (WIP, only Golang/JavaScript(JSX) now)

## Usage

### NeoVim Plugin Location on Mac

`~/.local/share/nvim/plugged`

### Plugin Manager

Use [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as plugin manager. Install Vim-Plug first following instructions by the author of Vim-Plug.

copy the config file into your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`. Save it and reopen a vim instance to run `:PlugInstall` or `<leader>pi` to install all plugins.

### Vim-Go

You might need to install additional go packages to use full feature of [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go). Please refer to the instructions.

### Vim-Python

TODO

### Vim-JavaScript

~### YouCompleteMe~

~YouCompleteMe requires additional installation and compile to enable its funtions. See the [YouCompleteMe Github repo](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)~

### coc.nvim

As a heavy vscode user, I do love the `lsp` developed by Microsoft. [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) is the most popular (I guess?) lsp client in vim/nvim. They also have very friendly docs and even Chinese docs! Ycm is good but seems a bit out of date
